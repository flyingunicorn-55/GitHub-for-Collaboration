# Fibonacci Sequence - Project Overview

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence follows this pattern:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

It is widely used in mathematics, computer science, and nature, appearing in everything from the arrangement of leaves on a stem to the spirals of galaxies.

This project includes a Python script that allows users to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The script demonstrates both recursion and iteration, providing an educational approach to understanding this famous sequence.
